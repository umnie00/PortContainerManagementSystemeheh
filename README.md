# PortContainerManagementSystemeheh

The Port Container Management System is a program that manages containers and ships at a port. It uses a stack to store containers, where the last container stored will be the first to be loaded. Ships are placed in a queue, meaning the first ship to arrive will be the first to be served. The program allows the user to add containers, register ships, and view the lists of both. It can also load a ship by taking the top container and giving it to the ship at the front of the line. This shows how stacks and queues work in a real-life situation.
